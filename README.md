## Supported Banners

| System   | Banner                  | Banner ID                  | Pity pool  |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Monopoly | Standard Board          | `Lottery_Permanent`        | Per-banner |
| Monopoly | Limited Character Board | `Lottery_LimitedCharacter` | Shared     |
| Gashapon | Arc Miracle Box         | `Arc_MiracleBox`           | Shared     |
| Gashapon | Mystery Box             | `Gashapon_MysteryBox`      | Per-rotation |

## What It Does

The exporter decodes Permanent Board, Limited Character Board, Arc Miracle Box,
and Mystery Box history pages from captured UDP data. It also captures tracked
achievements during login, including completed and in-progress records. Pull
history is written as tracker-ready JSON and achievements use a separate
versioned JSON format.

> [!NOTE]
> Export JSON contains decoded history or achievement records and the shareable
> NTE user UID when it can be detected. It does **not** export tokens, account
> IDs, role IDs, device IDs, server IPs, raw packets, cookies, session data, or
> other capture metadata.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer when running from source. Release binaries include the Python runtime.
- Packet-capture permission. On Windows, Npcap can usually capture without running this tool as Administrator; the raw-socket fallback may need Administrator. On Linux and macOS, use root or capture capabilities as required by your system.
- **Windows:** [Npcap](https://npcap.com/) is recommended. Install it normally; WinPcap API-compatible mode is not required. If Npcap is unavailable or cannot be initialized, `auto` falls back to the Windows built-in raw-socket backend.
- **Linux:** install the system **libpcap** runtime if it is not already present. Package names commonly include `libpcap0.8` on Debian/Ubuntu and `libpcap` on Fedora, Arch, and similar distributions.
- **macOS:** the system normally includes **libpcap**, so no separate Npcap installation is needed.

Npcap is Windows-only and is not bundled with this project. Linux and macOS use libpcap, the cross-platform capture library on which Npcap is based.

## Downloads

Compiled command-line builds are published on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Golumpa/nte-exporter/releases):

- `nte-history-exporter.exe` for Windows
- `nte-history-exporter-linux` for Linux
- `nte-history-exporter-macos` for macOS
- Versioned `.zip` archives for each platform

The Windows executable is a single console app. Start it from a terminal:

```powershell
.\nte-history-exporter.exe
```

On Linux and macOS, make the downloaded binary executable before running it. Use `sudo` only when your system requires elevated capture permission:

```bash
chmod +x ./nte-history-exporter-linux
sudo ./nte-history-exporter-linux
```

Use `nte-history-exporter-macos` in the same way on macOS. If your browser or OS blocks a downloaded macOS binary, allow it from the system security prompt before running it again.

## Usage

### Live capture

The default `auto` capture backend uses:

- **Windows:** Npcap when installed, with automatic fallback to the built-in Windows raw-socket backend.
- **Linux/macOS:** the system libpcap library.

Use `--capture-backend libpcap` to require Npcap/libpcap without fallback, or `--capture-backend raw` to require the Windows raw-socket backend.

#### Windows

Downloaded executable:

```powershell
.\nte-history-exporter.exe
```

From source:

```powershell
.\run-exporter.ps1
```

Or simply double-click **`run-exporter.cmd`**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Start the exporter **before pressing Start on the game's main menu**. This is
> required for achievement capture and enables automatic user UID and
> account-server detection. If already in game, pull-history capture still
> works, but achievements require returning to the main menu and logging in
> again; missing account details are requested before saving.

Once running, open any supported history board in game. The tool keeps listening until you press any key. After it prints and saves the results, press any key again to close the exporter. Exports are written under `exports\` as:

- `<user_uid>_Permanent_<date_time>.json`
- `<user_uid>_Limited_<date_time>.json`
- `<user_uid>_Arc_<date_time>.json`
- `<user_uid>_MysteryBox_<date_time>.json`
- `<user_uid>_Achievements_<date_time>.json`

If the user UID is not detected automatically, the console asks for it before saving. Leaving it blank saves as `unknown_<banner>_<date_time>.json`, but may prevent import on some trackers.

The export also includes `server_id` and `account_region` when known. If the
initial TCP server-selection response was missed, the console offers Asia,
America, Europe, and SEA as a numbered choice. The prompt can be left blank to
omit server information.

Exports are not copied to the clipboard by default. Add `--copy-clipboard` to copy a single captured banner's JSON after saving. If multiple banners are captured in the same run, clipboard copy is skipped so one banner does not overwrite another.

If a page response is missed, the exporter reports the missing page number while capture is still running. Leave the exporter open, close and reopen that history board, then scroll down again. Scrolling backward within the existing view does not request the cached pages again. The replacement capture is accepted and the tool confirms when the gap has been recovered. If reopening the board still produces no page messages, return to the main menu and re-enter the game to start a fresh connection.

### Achievement export

Start the live exporter before pressing Start on the game's main menu. The
tracked achievement state is loaded during login, captured automatically, and written to
`exports/<user_uid>_Achievements_*.json` as a versioned achievement export with
account metadata, completion totals, and records grouped by achievement category.
Both completed and in-progress achievements are included with their current
progress, status, and completion time when available. Generated metadata adds
the localized title and description, target, quality, and rewards from the
current `NTE_Assets` achievement table. Newly captured IDs that are not yet in
the bundled mapping still export normally; only their optional display metadata
is omitted until the mappings are refreshed.
PlayStation trophy entries are retained and identified separately
even though they are not shown in the in-game achievement list. The console
reports completed and in-progress totals for in-game and PlayStation records as
soon as the list has been decoded. Every observed record without a completion
timestamp is classified as `in_progress`, even when its numeric progress is
zero; compound achievements can track hidden checklist progress this way.

#### Linux/macOS

Downloaded executable, using `sudo` when your system requires elevated capture permission:

```bash
chmod +x ./nte-history-exporter-linux
sudo ./nte-history-exporter-linux
```

From source, install the project and ensure the system libpcap runtime is available:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
sudo .venv/bin/nte-history-exporter
```

macOS normally includes libpcap. On Linux, install the distribution's libpcap runtime package if it is not already present. Capture can also be granted through platform-specific capabilities instead of running the whole exporter with `sudo`.

### File replay

Downloaded executable:

```powershell
.\nte-history-exporter.exe capture.flows
```

From source:

```powershell
.\run-exporter.ps1 capture.flows
```

Decodes a `mitmproxy .flows` capture instead of listening live — used for research and testing.

### Options

| Flag      | Effect                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--live`  | Capture live traffic, including achievements loaded at login. |
| `--debug` | Also write the research CSV and privacy-safe capture diagnostics. |
| `--user-uid <uid>` | Override the auto-detected NTE user UID in the JSON export. |
| `--copy-clipboard` | Copy a single live export JSON to clipboard after saving. |

Advanced live-capture selection:

```text
--capture-backend auto      Prefer Npcap/libpcap; fall back to raw sockets on Windows
--capture-backend libpcap   Require Npcap on Windows or libpcap on Linux/macOS
--capture-backend raw       Require the Windows raw-socket backend
```

The `--debug` CSV holds decoded research fields, including raw captured history
records. A separate versioned `*.diagnostics.json` sidecar provides shareable
reason codes and counts without payloads, network addresses, ports, packet
timestamps, or user UID values. See [Capture diagnostics](docs/capture-diagnostics.md).

The exporter automatically includes the shareable NTE user UID when it appears in the capture. If a short capture does not include it, the console asks before saving; you can also pass it explicitly with `--user-uid`.

> [!TIP]
> For reliable deduplication, start from page 1 and scroll through the pages. If you only want pages 1–5, scroll through to page 6 as well just to be on the safe side.

## Mapping maintenance

Reward and achievement metadata can be rebuilt directly from the latest
NTE_Assets tables and English translation files. Mapping snapshots may change
IDs while UID inputs remain untouched:

Run **Update mappings** from the GitHub Actions tab to generate and test
the snapshot in a reviewable pull request, or run it locally:

```powershell
python tools/update_mappings.py
```

This rebuilds reviewable mapping candidates directly from NTE_Assets under
`build/mapping-update/`; committed mappings are untouched unless `--apply` is
explicitly supplied. The snapshot may include additions, updates, and removals,
while pool mappings and UID inputs remain untouched. See
[Mapping updates](docs/mapping-updates.md) for the source rules and
review workflow.

## Privacy

> [!CAUTION]
> Sanitized exports are intended for tracker import and should not contain anything especially harmful, but they can identify the game account via user UID and pull history. Share exports only with verified sources, such as known trackers. Do not commit packet captures, generated exports, research briefs, or personal account data. The repository keeps `exports/` as an empty output folder but ignores everything generated inside it.

## Boundary Policy

NTE history records do not appear to contain a unique server-side roll ID. UIDs are generated from decoded record fields and the record's order within all rows sharing the same raw timestamp.

History always loads page 1 first and is scrolled downward, so the exporter anchors to the continuous run of pages starting at page 1 and ignores anything after the first gap (with a warning). This keeps the newest pages even if a later page is lost, and guarantees the newest timestamp group's ordinal 0 is captured.

Within a timestamp group, ordinal 0 is the newest record and unseen rows can only append after the captured ones, so **every exported UID is stable** — including a partially captured oldest 10-pull. All decoded rows are therefore exported. Re-scanning later simply adds any rows that were not yet captured, with the same UIDs for the rows already seen.

For Monopoly, Points Gift and Chase Reward rows stay in the timestamp group for UID ordinal generation, but only `result_type = dice` rows count toward pull-set sizing. Arc pulls are always 10-pulls. Mystery Box records are single pulls and the final page may contain fewer than five records. Every captured group is exported, including an incomplete oldest pull set, because its captured prefix is ordinal-stable.

## Adapters

**Current**

- Live Npcap/libpcap capture on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Live Windows raw-socket fallback
- `mitmproxy .flows` research decoder

**Planned**

- Optional pktmon diagnostics for capture-drop investigation
- UI wrapper around the CLI
